# Music Popularity and Trends Analysis Across Spotify and YouTube

## Project Overview

Aims is to analyze and compare the popularity and trends of music tracks across Spotify and YouTube, identifying patterns, correlations, and insights. By leveraging multiple free-to-use APIs, we will gather data on music tracks and videos for various artists. The analysis will be performed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Objectives

- Fetch data on popular music tracks using the Spotify API.
- Obtain data on music videos for the same tracks using the YouTube Data API.
- Perform data cleaning and preparation to handle missing values and merge datasets.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
- Visualize the data using various plotting techniques.
- Summarize key findings and provide actionable insights.

## APIs Used

1. **Spotify API**: For fetching data on music tracks, including features like popularity, danceability, energy, and more.
2. **YouTube Data API**: For obtaining data on music videos, including view counts, likes, comments, and more.

## Analysis Questions

1. **Popularity**:
   - Which tracks are the most popular on Spotify?
   - Which music videos have the highest view counts on YouTube?
   - How does the popularity of a track on Spotify correlate with its view count on YouTube?

2. **Feature**:
   - What are the common characteristics (e.g., danceability, energy) of popular tracks on Spotify?
   - How do these characteristics vary across different genres?
   - Are there any specific features that are strongly correlated with a track's popularity?

3. **Trend**:
   - How has the popularity of certain tracks changed over time on Spotify and YouTube?
   - Are there any noticeable trends in the types of music that are becoming more popular?
   - How do seasonal trends (e.g., holiday music) affect the popularity of tracks?

4. **Comparative**:
   - How do the popularity metrics (e.g., likes, comments) on YouTube compare with the popularity metrics on Spotify?
   - Are there any significant differences in the popularity of tracks across different regions or countries?
   - How do the engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) on YouTube correlate with the popularity metrics on Spotify?

5. **Audience**:
   - What are the demographic characteristics of the audience for popular tracks on Spotify and YouTube?
   - How do these demographics vary across different genres and artists?
   - Are there any specific audience segments that are more likely to engage with certain types of music?

6. **Sentiment**:
   - What is the sentiment of comments on YouTube music videos for popular tracks?
   - How does the sentiment of comments correlate with the popularity of the track?
   - Are there any noticeable patterns in the sentiment of comments across different genres?

7. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the analysis, what recommendations can be made to artists for increasing the popularity of their tracks?
   - How can music streaming platforms use this analysis to improve their recommendation algorithms?
   - What strategies can be implemented to enhance audience engagement on both Spotify and YouTube?
